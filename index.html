        <h1>The Top 3 Grossing Tours All Time</h1>
        <div id="images"></div>

        <ul><li>Ed Sheeran: ÷ Tour 2017-19</li></ul>
           <p>The ÷ Tour (pronounced ‘Divide Tour’) in support of his third studio album kicked off on 16 March 2017, in Turin, Italy ending on 26 August 2019, in Ipswich, England. The one-man show set world records for the highest-grossing concert tour and the most tickets sold by a tour. It also became the most attended tour of all time with over 8.5 million having attended in 43 different countries. Several shows were postponed in April 2017 after Sheeran broke both arms and a rib after crashing his bicycle near his home in Suffolk.</p> 
         <ul><li>U2: 360° Tour 2009–11</li></ul>
           <p>Sponsored by BlackBerry and in support of the group’s 2009 album No Line on the Horizon, the concerts featured U2 playing ‘in the round’ on a circular stage, allowing the audience to surround them on all sides. To accommodate the stage configuration, a large 170-ton, $40 million four-legged structure nicknamed ‘The Claw’ was built above the stage. The Claw was so enormous that it took two days to dismantle. It was reported that this tour cost $750,000 a day to run as three separate models of the biggest stage in rock history traveled around the world. The group of individuals involved in this tour clocked in at over 250, and that doesn’t include all of the staffers working for the vendors involved on the tour. U2 to gave €9m of tour profits to charity.</p>
          <ul><li>Guns N’ Roses: Not in This Lifetime… Tour 2016-19</li></ul>
            <p>The tour’s name is a reference to a 2012 interview in which Axl Rose, when asked about when a potential reunion would happen, responded “not in this lifetime.” It brought together the classic Guns N’ Roses line-up with Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan, marking the first time since the Use Your Illusion Tour in 1993 that the three performed together. The set was designed by Phil Ealy. They built a 71-foot (22 m) wide main stage including band risers, LED staircases made with P9 LED video tiles, LED fascia and amp stacks, and a self-climber piano lift used for Rose’s performance of ‘November Rain.’</p>
